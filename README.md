# 🏦 Banking Domain Data Analysis Using Tableau  

### 🖥️ [View the Tableau Dashboards Here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/karthikeya.kanumuri/viz/MitronProject/ExpenditureTrendsandPatterns)

As part of a data challenge, I was provided with a dataset related to the banking domain. I utilized Tableau to clean, analyze, and visualize this data, eventually building and publishing three dashboards:  

1. **Customer Demographics** 🧑‍🤝‍🧑  
2. **Expenditure Trends & Patterns** 💰  
3. **Comparative & Deep-Dive Analysis** 🔍  

These dashboards provide actionable insights into customer behavior, spending habits, and demographics, which can be pivotal for decision-making.

## 🛠️ **Process Overview**  

### 🔍 Understanding the Dataset:  
The dataset included details like customer demographics, income, expenditures, regional distribution, occupations, and payment methods.  

### 🧹 Preparation:  
- Cleaned the data to handle nulls and inconsistencies.  
- Created calculated fields for specific metrics such as expenditure percentages, income group segmentation, and payment type analysis.  
- Used Level of Detail (LOD) expressions to compute aggregations at different levels for more precise insights.  

### 📊 Dashboard Design:  
- **Parameters:** Added parameters to provide users flexibility, such as setting ranges for income and expenditure.  
- **Slicers:** Enabled users to filter insights dynamically.  
- **Structure:** Designed dashboards to ensure easy navigation and clarity, catering to both high-level overviews and granular analysis.

## 📈 **Expenditure Trends & Patterns**  

### 👫 Spending by Marital Status & Gender:  
- Married males spend the most (**54%**), followed by married females (**27%**), single males (**14%**), and single females (**5%**).  
- This aligns with demographics as **83%** are aged 25+ (usually married).  

### 💸 Expenditure as % of Income:  
- Both males and females spend approximately **41-45%** of their income, showing no major difference in spending habits.  

### 💳 Payment Methods:  
- **Credit Card:** 41%  
- **UPI:** 27%  
- **Debit:** 23%  
- **Net Banking:** 10%  

### 📦 Category-Wise Expenditure:  
- **Bills:** 17M (highest).  
- **Groceries:** 14M.  
- **Electronics:** 13M.  
- **Entertainment:** 7M.  
- **Apparel:** 6M.  

### 📅 Monthly Expenditure Trends:  
- Data spans **May to October**, showing:  
  - Increase from May to July (**33%-38%-39%**).  
  - Steep rise in August and September (**49%-56%**).  
  - Drop in October (**42%**).  

This could be due to:  
1. **Festive Seasons:** September aligns with Back-to-School/University shopping and festivals in India.  
2. **Lack of Data:** Only six months of data make it unclear if this pattern is seasonal or a one-time occurrence.  

### 🏙️ City-Wise Expenditure:  
- **Mumbai:** Highest expenditure (**29M, 51% of income**), indicating it is an expensive city.  
- **Delhi:** 19M (48%).  
- **Hyderabad:** Lower overall expenditure due to fewer customers but a higher expenditure percentage than Chennai.

## 🔬 **Comparative & Deep-Dive Analysis**  

### 🎯 Age Group Analysis:  
- **25-34** and **35-45** are the highest spenders due to their higher proportion in the customer base.

### 👨‍💻 Occupation Analysis:  
- **IT employees** contribute **244M (~45% of total expenditure)** due to their higher salaries and larger representation in the dataset.  

### 💳 Payment Methods by Category:  
- **Credit Card:** Dominant for most categories.  
- **UPI:** Most used for groceries, likely due to street vendors not having card machines.  

### 👫 Spending Patterns by Gender and Age Group:
